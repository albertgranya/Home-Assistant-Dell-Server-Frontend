About Folders:

Home Assistant Config:

All files for Home Assistant configuration
just missing heartbeat gifs because I'm not sure if I can share them, maybe they are copyrighted.

Scripts in Dell server host Fan Control:

This will be installed on a linux host, because Home Assistant cannot use ipmitool easily.
This works with Mqtt server, home assistant has one.
